(autoload 'company-mode "company" "\
\"complete anything\"; is an in-buffer completion framework.
Completion starts automatically, depending on the values
`company-idle-delay' and `company-minimum-prefix-length'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Company mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable
the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `company-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Completion can be controlled with the commands:
`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are
called before `company-idle-delay', completion will also start.

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or
`company-filter-candidates'.  These can be used while completion is
inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

By default, the completions list is sorted alphabetically, unless the
backend chooses otherwise, or `company-transformers' changes it later.

`project-find-functions'.  The search for active projects in this
