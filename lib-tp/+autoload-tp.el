(autoload 'company-mode "company" "\
\"complete anything\"; is an in-buffer completion framework.
Completion starts automatically, depending on the values
`company-idle-delay' and `company-minimum-prefix-length'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Company mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable
the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `company-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Completion can be controlled with the commands:
`company-complete-common', `company-complete-selection', `company-complete',
`company-select-next', `company-select-previous'.  If these commands are
called before `company-idle-delay', completion will also start.

Completions can be searched with `company-search-candidates' or
`company-filter-candidates'.  These can be used while completion is
inactive, as well.

The completion data is retrieved using `company-backends' and displayed
using `company-frontends'.  If you want to start a specific backend, call
it interactively or use `company-begin-backend'.

By default, the completions list is sorted alphabetically, unless the
backend chooses otherwise, or `company-transformers' changes it later.

Manage a project with a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.

The LSP server of CLASS is started (or contacted) via CONTACT.
If this operation is successful, current *and future* file
buffers of MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE inside PROJECT become \"managed\"
by the LSP server, meaning information about their contents is
exchanged periodically to provide enhanced code-analysis via
`xref-find-definitions', `flymake-mode', `eldoc-mode',
`completion-at-point', among others.

Interactively, the command attempts to guess MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE
from current buffer, CLASS and CONTACT from
`eglot-server-programs' and PROJECT from
`project-find-functions'.  The search for active projects in this
context binds `eglot-lsp-context' (which see).

If it can't guess, the user is prompted.  With a single
\\[universal-argument] prefix arg, it always prompt for COMMAND.
With two \\[universal-argument] prefix args, also prompts for
MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE.

PROJECT is a project object as returned by `project-current'.

CLASS is a subclass of `eglot-lsp-server'.

CONTACT specifies how to contact the server.  It is a
keyword-value plist used to initialize CLASS or a plain list as
described in `eglot-server-programs', which see.

LANGUAGE-ID is the language ID string to send to the server for
MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE, which matters to a minority of servers.
